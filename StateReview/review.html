		<h1><a href = "https://www.tn.gov/">1. Tennessee</a></h1>
			<p> Visually and Functionally, the best website of these five is the Tennessee<br>
				State website. With very clearly labelled links to the different subsites and <br>
				an informative calender for public events and links to social media, this website<br>
				makes it easy for a citizen to connect and get involved with their government,<br>
				without it being tedious. The only possible complaint one could have for this<br>
				website is that it is themed too casually and lacks professionality</p>
				
		<h1><a href = "https://mt.gov/">2. Montana</a></h1>
			<p>The Montana State website is a close second behind Tennessee. It improves upon<br>
				the complaint I had with the Tennessee site that lacked professionality. This<br>
				website certainly looks more professional but could use a bit more style, some of<br>
				the links don't stand out from the whitebar at the top and could make navigating<br>
				more difficult</p>
				
		<h1><a href = "https://www.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx#home">3. West Virginia</a></h1>
			<p>This State's Website is the last of the five websites where I find little to<br>
				The layout of this homepage certainly makes everything available to you, albeit<br>
				in a confusing way. It took me a few minutes of using the site to realize that<br>
				more links were made available to you if you used the arrows on the left and<br>
				righthand sides of the screen. Visually, my only complaint is how sleek and<br>
				straight the navigation bar is at the top and how curvy and rugged the footer is<br>
				at the bottom of the screen, they conflict with each other and I find it slightly<br>
				annoying.</p>
				
		<h1><a href = "http://sd.gov/">4. South Dakota</a></h1>
			<p>The South Dakota website isn't terrible however there are a few things visually,<br>
				and functionally that I could imagine make it difficult to use. There are very few<br>
				links to the subpages from the front page and makes it so that in order to access<br>
				additional information one would have to go through and inevitable get lost in all<br>
				of the menus the designer used in trying to keep the front page un-cluttered.<br>
				Also, on the bottom of the site, the footer casts a shadow on the image but on the<br>
				top of the page, which uses very similar design, no shadow is cast and this visually<br>
				disrupts the site</p>
		
		<h1><a href = "http://louisiana.gov/">5. Louisiana</a></h1>
			<p>Louisiana's website is, by a significant margin, the worst website of the five.<br>
				The website uses incredibly dated and unoriginal design and looks like it hasn't<br>
				updated in years, evidence given by the fact the social media icons for the state's<br>
				youtube, facebook and twitter were all changed years ago. The use of very small font<br>
				and a lack of clear labelling for the information your looking at makes the front page<br>
				alone a nightmare.</p>
