				<h1><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a></h1>
					<p>Youtube has been one of the largest social media platforms
					for as long as I can remember and over my years of using the site
					I can deduce this is because they are constantly updating their site
					to keep it aesthetically pleasing. But what does the code of one
					of the largest websites actually look like? Well after looking at it myself,
					if appears to mostly be java script with div elements making up the rest,
					laying out the location of the thumbnails. So while the site is pleasant to
					look at, it hogs resources from the users computer and it is not easy to
					understand what is going on.</p>
					
				<h1><a href = "https://www.cardkingdom.com/">Card Kingdom</a></h1>
					<p>Card Kingdom is a site that is used for the purchase and trading of cards
					used in various card games, primarily Magicka. The site is incredibly simple
					straight-forward. Every action one would expect to do on this site can be accessed
					in the nav bar. Anything else that one would like to do can be found at the footer.
					The only complaint with the visuals is that with an ad-blocker, the sight looks very
					plain. As for the code, I was surprised to see that a site as fairly simple as this
					is again made up of a lot of java script, the only HTML I was able to somewhat understand
					lay at the footer</p>
					
				<h1><a href = "Louisiana.gov">Louisiana State Website</a></h1>
					<p>The website uses incredibly dated and unoriginal design and looks like it hasn't
						updated in years, evidence given by the fact the social media icons for the state's
						youtube, facebook and twitter were all changed years ago. The use of very small font and
						lack of clear labelling for the information you are looking at makes the front page
						a nightmare. The code however is very straight-forward and easy to understand, the entire
						site does rely significantly on tables to layout its information. Strangely enough, the
						site seems to look better on my mobile device rather than my laptop.
