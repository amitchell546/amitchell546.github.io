		<h1>This Website</h1>
		
			<p>This website is a review and comparison of these three web hosting providers:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/hosting">bluehost</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.sitebuilder.com/">SITEBUILDER</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>1. bluehost</h2>
		
			<p>Blue host was founded in 1996 and has quickly become a very popular webhost provider</p>
			<p>with over 2,000,000 websites being hosted through them. They have very impressive</p>
			<p>and can boast an uptime over 99.99%, an average loading time of less than 424ms, and</p>
			<p>very competitive pricing, starting as low as just $2.75 a month. However a website this</p>
			<p>must come with some drawbacks, according to user reviews, while their customer support</p>
			<p>is very fast they lack knowledge on more technical issues. In addition, their $2.75 a</p>
			<p>month price tag is only available with a 3 year long contract.</p>
		
		<h2>2. HostGator</h2>
		
			<p>HostGator was founded in 2003 in a the florida dorm room of Brent Oxley. Since it's</p>
			<p>conception it has become one of the most recognizable names in webhosting. With uptimes</p>
			<p>that are .04% higher than the industry standard as well as comprehensive customer support.</p>
			<p>However, their loading times are not great, falling 10% slower in loading times compared</p>
			<p>to competitors. They also have the same lengthy contract you must sign on with if you want</p>
			<p>a good deal.</p>
			
		<h2>3. SITEBUILDER</h2>
			<p>SITEBUILDER is a free website hosting service with a built in website designer. They</p>
			<p>sadly do not offer all of their services entirely free, in exchange for their hosting.,</p>
			<p>ads run on your page, which isn't that big of a deal being that many web hosting options</p>
			<p>require lengthy paid contracts. However they have some of the most atrocious customer</p>
			<p>service, with unhelpful and outsourced personnel. They also throttle loading speeds for</p>
			<p>free users, if you want higher load times you have to upgrade from their free version.</p>
